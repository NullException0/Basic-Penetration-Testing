ARP Poisoning - MITM ARP Poisoning with Ettercap

+ Running ettercap
	#ettercap -G

+ Select sniffing option
	++ If connected physically through network interface, switch or hub, recommended use Bridged sniffing
	++ If just using adapter from vm, I suggest using Unified sniffing, I'm using a vm so I use this.

+ Select network interface

+ Go Targets menu and select current targets or ctrl + t

+ Add target 1 using Default gateway IP address

+ Add target 2 using target victim IP address

+ To start ARP Poisoning, Go to MITM menu and select ARP Poisoning, popup will appear and must select Sniff remote connection then clik ok

+ Now you can start to sniffing and packet capture the traffic using packet capture tools such as tcpdump, wireshark etc.

+ Using TCPdump from capturing packet and traffic from victim machine
	# tcpdump -i [interface] -n port 80 and host [target IP address]
	# tcpdump -i eth0 -n port 80 and host 192.168.202.142
	
+ Using wireshark is easier option for me as of now.. lol
