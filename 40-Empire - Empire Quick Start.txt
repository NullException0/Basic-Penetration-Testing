Empire Terminology

+ Stager - Establishes connection to Empire C2 server (payload that run on victim machine)
+ Listeners - Service on Empire C2 server that receives and handles connections from executed stagers
+ Agents - Infected hosts
+ Modules - Scripts that perform specific tasks on an infected host, such as gaining persistence, performing privilege escalation, etc.


How Empire works

+ Essentially you start with a listener running on the Empire control server.
+ Get Stager code onto the victim which infecting target machine and get persistance.
+ Once Stager in run, it establishes connection with Empire command and control server.
+ At this point, Empire C2 server can execute modules and other commands on the victim machine to get desire result.


How Empire Command and Control

+ Empire C2 agents are asynchronous which means agents will periodically send small connections to the C2 server to poll for tasking.
+ Uses HTTP GET requests to poll for taskings
+ Uses HTTP POST request to send data
+ Empire communications are encrypted and designed to appear benign
+ Empire act as One to Many connection
+ Agent can pull task periodically not in continously established connection
