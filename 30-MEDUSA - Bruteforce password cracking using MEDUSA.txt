	ALERT: Host information must be supplied.

	Syntax: Medusa [-h host|-H file] [-u username|-U file] [-p password|-P file] [-C file] -M module [OPT]
	  -h [TEXT]    : Target hostname or IP address
	  -H [FILE]    : File containing target hostnames or IP addresses
	  -u [TEXT]    : Username to test
	  -U [FILE]    : File containing usernames to test
	  -p [TEXT]    : Password to test
	  -P [FILE]    : File containing passwords to test
	  -C [FILE]    : File containing combo entries. See README for more information.
	  -O [FILE]    : File to append log information to
	  -e [n/s/ns]  : Additional password checks ([n] No Password, [s] Password = Username)
	  -M [TEXT]    : Name of the module to execute (without the .mod extension)
	  -m [TEXT]    : Parameter to pass to the module. This can be passed multiple times with a
					 different parameter each time and they will all be sent to the module (i.e.
					 -m Param1 -m Param2, etc.)
	  -d           : Dump all known modules
	  -n [NUM]     : Use for non-default TCP port number
	  -s           : Enable SSL
	  -g [NUM]     : Give up after trying to connect for NUM seconds (default 3)
	  -r [NUM]     : Sleep NUM seconds between retry attempts (default 3)
	  -R [NUM]     : Attempt NUM retries before giving up. The total number of attempts will be NUM + 1.
	  -c [NUM]     : Time to wait in usec to verify socket is available (default 500 usec).
	  -t [NUM]     : Total number of logins to be tested concurrently
	  -T [NUM]     : Total number of hosts to be tested concurrently
	  -L           : Parallelize logins using one username per thread. The default is to process 
					 the entire username before proceeding.
	  -f           : Stop scanning host after first valid username/password found.
	  -F           : Stop audit after first valid username/password found on any host.
	  -b           : Suppress startup banner
	  -q           : Display module's usage information
	  -v [NUM]     : Verbose level [0 - 6 (more)]
	  -w [NUM]     : Error debug level [0 - 10 (more)]
	  -V           : Display version
	  -Z [TEXT]    : Resume scan based on map of previous scan
