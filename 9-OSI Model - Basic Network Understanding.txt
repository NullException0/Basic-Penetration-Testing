OSI Model - to understanding on network scanning

+ Open system Interconnection
+ To understad NMAP perform scanning
+ NMAP uses the network and transport layer

Network layer

+ layer used for transfer or flow of packets across the network
+ IP version IPv4, IPv6
+ specifies the format of packets and contains addressing information that enables packets to be routed
+ provide only the functions that are neccessary to deliver a packet from a source to a destination over interconnected system of networks


IPv4 Packet header

+ IPv4 protocol defines different field in the packet header.
+ These fields contain binary values that the IPv4 services reference as they forward packets across the network
+ IPv4 packet header contain
	++ IP Source Address - packet source
	++ IP Destination Address - packet destination
	++ Time-to-Live (TTL) - An 8-bit values that indicates the remaining life of the packet
	++ Type-of-Service (ToS) - The Type-of-Service field contains an 8-bit binary value that is used to determine the priority of each packet
	++ Protocol - This 8-bit value indicates the data payload type that the packet is carrying


Transport Layer

+ used for the transfer of packets between 2 hosts for the application layer
+ Protocol used in L4
	++ ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
	++ UDP - User Datagram Protocol
	++ TCP - Transmission Control Protocol

ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol

+ Error reporting protocol and is used by routers, hosts and network devices to generate error messages when there are problems delivering IP packets
	++ Used to send messages
	++ used to perform network diagnostics
+ ICMP is not ad transport protocol that sends data between systems
+ ICMP Header
	++ has 2 type of messages which is the request and response pair
		+++ Example: echo request, timestamp request


UDP - User Datagram Protocol

+ Used primarily for establishing low-latency connection between application on the internet
	++ Unreliable - has no guarentee of delivery
	++ Connectionless - no handshake process
+ UDP header
	++ Source Port - selected from the unused list of ports
	++ Destination Port - Selected from the static and well known ports
		+++ Example: Web server run on port 80


TCP - Transmission Control Protocol

+ Is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation via which application programs can exchange data.
	- Reliable and ordered
+ TCP Header contain
	++ Source port
	++ Destination port
	++ Flags
